# BreakoutRL
Project on Breakout and Assault

I was tinkering with open AI Gym and seeing how these new algorithms performed. This definetly helped me more to understand algorithms such as DQN.
To get a tensorbaord graph so show you the average episode reward as well as average episode lenght and other mertrics.
What I did was go to the directory using command prompt where the logs are stored and then did the following command:


tensorboard --logdir "first run_3"


It should then provide you with a local host link, copy and paste it to see metrics.
